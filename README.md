# Pickipedia

The complete compendium of japes and judgements about the Pickies, a totally real
and definitely long-running
Apple predictions game played on [Connected](https://relay.fm/connected/).

[View the actual site itself here](https://pickipedia.net/). 

The page is almost entirely contained in index.html. I edit it by running a 
TiddlyWiki Node server and exporting an "offline" copy for the published site.
It's all completely static, including searching, because it's implemented in
JavaScript and TiddlyWiki sites contain all the code, styling, and data.
The only external resources are the favicons and site logo.

"Corrections" and "clarifications" are more than welcome, just file an issue here
on GitHub. It's not important that it *is* true, just that it *feels* true, you know?
Pull requests are probably going to be difficult to integrate, so
opening an issue with your thoughts is preferred.
