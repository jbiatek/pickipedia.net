The losers flip a coin to determine who goes first and who goes third.

Whether or not you can prove a negative is best left for the philosophers.</li><li>No altering the prediction document after the show is over. We all remember what happened in 2020.</li><li>After scoring is complete, each host must place the official Pickies Refrigerator Magnets in the proper configuration on their refrigerator for the next year. Winner at the center of the door, second place in the lower left corner, third place in the lower right corner.</li><li>The winner of each competition will be given access to the <a href="https://twitter.com/wwdcshindigking" target="_blank">@wwdcshindigking</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/pickiesadmiral" target="_blank">@pickiesadmiral</a> twitter accounts, as appropriate.</li></ol></div><hr><h2 class="">Notes</h2><p>The official copy of the Charter is on <a href="https://jsnell.micro.blog/2021/12/22/the-pickies-charter.html" target="_blank">Jason Snell's microblog</a>.</p><p>While not currently codified in the Charter, there is an additional rule for the Lightning Round: picks are made in rounds in draft format, so repeats are not allowed, and hosts may drop out at any time (although this is rare). In addition, the number of picks is capped at 5.</p></div>
