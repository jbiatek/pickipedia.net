In addition, the number of picks is capped at 5.</p><h2 class="">Changes</h2><ul><li>#275: After a long series of drafts with unsettlingly increasing frequency, including the "Apple Executive Draft", the "Macintosh Performa Draft", the "First Party Mouse Draft", and the "Power Cable Draft", the draft mania hits a peak with a "Connected Draft Draft" which occurs <em>during</em> the "PowerPC Processor Draft". A line has to be drawn, and one-off drafts are banned. To replace them, a strictly limited Apple predictions draft is started instead, for WWDC and for the full calendar year. A three point round, a two point round, and as many 1 point predictions as desired. In addition, points are doubled in the first half of the year. The previous winner gets the best drafting spot. Ties will be resolved by coin toss by Jason, who is objectively the best in the group at tossing a coin.</li><li>#278: After a few weeks of thought, James comes up with a clever solution that he calculates will always break a tie: subtract five times the percentage incorrect from each score. Jason objects to the loss of his sweet coin flipping gig, so instead a coin flip will be used to decide who drafts first. </li><li>#299: Upon reading the rules before the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="2020%2520WWDC%2520Pickies.html">2020 WWDC Pickies</a>, it is discovered that the rule about the previous winner getting the best draft position was never removed after the last rule change. However, John successfully argues that there actually is no contradiction: the best draft position is actually the second one, since you get a peek at your opponent without going last. As such, the coin flip to decide who goes first is fine. The rules are clarified to reflect this impeccable logic.</li><li>#300: After <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="2020%2520WWDC%2520Pickies.html">James makes 12 Lightning Round picks in one game</a>, a cap of 5 is put on the Lightning Round to keep the episodes a reasonable length.</li><li>#327: The full extent of <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="2020%2520Annual%2520Pickies*.html">what happened in 2020</a> may never be known publicly, but what we do know is disturbing enough as it is. Thankfully, new rules were put in place to, hopefully, prevent events like this again: <ul><li>The prediction document is not to be altered after the show is over.</li><li>Hosts cannot make a pick come true by taking action or inducing others.</li></ul></li><li>#349: After <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="2021%2520WWDC%2520Pickies.html">a game ends with a logically indeterminate outcome</a>, picks must be provably true or false to earn points, and must be just about Apple or the tech industry.</li><li>#377: <ul><li>Clarified that the wrong answer percentage deduction rule means percentage <em>as a fraction</em>, not as a percentage. For example, 1 out of four means deducting by (0.25) * 5, not 25 * 5.</li><li>Finally corrected the triple negative in the "tech industry relevance" rule.</li><li>James expressed some concern that the refrigerator magnets may not stick to all fridges, but Jason points out that the rule doesn't specify the method of adhesion, just the locations of the magnets.</li></ul></li></ul></div>
